# Verification Walkthrough

The **Smart Job Seeking and Hiring Platform** has been successfully implemented. Follow these steps to verify the application functions as expected.

## prerequisites
- Ensure XAMPP (or WAMP/LAMP) is installed and running.
- Ensure the database `smart_job_platform` is created and tables exist (use [database.sql](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/database.sql) if needed).
- Place the project files in your `htdocs` directory (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\smart_job_platform`).
- Update [config.php](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/config.php) if your MySQL credentials differ from `root` / `""`.

## 1. User Registration Verification
1. Navigate to `http://localhost/smart_job_platform/index.php`.
2. Click **"I'm a Job Seeker"**.
3. Fill in the registration form (e.g., `seeker1`, `seeker@test.com`, `password`, `Job Seeker`).
4. **Expected Result**: Success message "Registration successful! You can now Login.".
5. Repeat for a Recruiter (e.g., `recruiter1`, `recruiter@test.com`, `password`, `Recruiter`).

## 2. Job Seeker Profile Flow
1. Login as the Job Seeker.
2. You should be redirected to the **Seeker Dashboard**.
3. Click **"Edit Profile"**.
4. Enter details:
   - Full Name: `John Doe`
   - Phone: `1234567890`
   - Education: `B.Tech in CS`
   - Skills: `PHP, MySQL, JavaScript`
   - Upload a dummy resume file.
5. Click **"Save Changes"**.
6. **Expected Result**: "Profile updated successfully!" and dashboard updates with new info.

## 3. Recruiter Search Flow
1. Logout and Login as the Recruiter.
2. You should be redirected to the **Recruiter Dashboard**.
3. In the search bar, enter `PHP`.
4. Click **"Search"**.
5. **Expected Result**: `John Doe` should appear in the results card.

## 4. Contact & Notification Flow

3. Click the green **"Contact via SMS"** button.
4. **Expected Result**: A success screen with a big Green Checkmark saying "SMS Notification Sent!".
5. (Optional) Check the `notifications` table in the database to see the record.

## 5. Security & Validation
- Try accessing [/seeker/dashboard.php](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/seeker/dashboard.php) without logging in. **Expected Result**: Redirect to login.
- Try accessing [/recruiter/dashboard.php](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/recruiter/dashboard.php) as a Seeker. **Expected Result**: Redirect to login (or error).

## 6. Static Preview (Run without PHP)
If you do not have a PHP server running, you can view the design using the **Static HTML Preview**:
1. Open the file [c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity Codes/static_preview/index.html](file:///Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/static_preview/index.html) in your web browser.
2. You can navigate through the pages:
   - Click "I'm a Job Seeker" -> Register -> Login -> Dashboard.
   - Click "Login" -> Login as Recruiter -> Dashboard.
3. This mode is for **UI verification only** and does not support data saving or real functionality.

## 7. Deployment to XAMPP/WAMP
To run the full PHP application:

### Step 1: Copy Files
1. Locate your XAMPP/WAMP installation directory (usually `C:\xampp` or `C:\wamp64`).
2. Open the `htdocs` (for XAMPP) or `www` (for WAMP) folder.
3. Create a new folder named `smart_job_platform`.
4. Copy all files from your project folder (`c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity Codes/`) into this new folder.

### Step 2: Database Setup
1. Open XAMPP/WAMP Control Panel and start **Apache** and **MySQL**.
2. Go to [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin) in your browser.
3. Click **New**, enter database name `smart_job_platform`, and click **Create**.
4. Click **Import** tab, choose the `database.sql` file from your project, and click **Import**.

### Step 3: Configure Connection
1. If your MySQL root password is not empty (default is empty), open `config.php` in the deployed folder.
2. Update the `$password` value.

### Step 4: Run
- Access the site at: `http://localhost/smart_job_platform/`
