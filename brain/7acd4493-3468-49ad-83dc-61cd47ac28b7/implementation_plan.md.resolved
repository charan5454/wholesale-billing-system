# Borrower Repayment Status Feature

The user wants to track whether a loan has been repaid and filter the borrower list accordingly.

## Proposed Changes

### Database
#### [MODIFY] [database.js](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/database.js)
- Add `is_repaid` column to the `borrowers` table with a default value of `FALSE`.

### Server
#### [MODIFY] [server.js](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/server.js)
- Add `PATCH /api/borrowers/:id/status` endpoint to update the `is_repaid` status.
- Ensure only the owner can update the status.

### UI
#### [MODIFY] [index.html](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/public/index.html)
- **Navbar**: Remove the "Status" nav item.
- **Borrower Modal**: Add a status filter dropdown (ALL, YES, NO) next to the "Borrower List" heading inside the modal.

### Logic
#### [MODIFY] [app.js](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/public/js/app.js)
- Update status filter selector to find the new dropdown in the modal.
- Ensure the dropdown only appears when the user is logged in (already handled by modal visibility).
- Update the [updateAuthUI](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/public/js/app.js#336-351) to remove references to the old navbar status container.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Add a borrower.
2. In the "Manage Borrowers" list, find the "Is Repaid" column.
3. Toggle the dropdown from "NO" to "YES".
4. Refresh the page to ensure the status persisted.
5. Click on the "Status" nav item and select "YES".
6. Confirm only repaid borrowers are shown.
7. Select "NO" and confirm only unpaid borrowers are shown.
8. Select "ALL" to see everything again.
