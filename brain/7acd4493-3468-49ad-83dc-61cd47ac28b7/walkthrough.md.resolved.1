# Visibility and Branding Update Walkthrough

I have updated the application branding and improved input visibility as requested.

## Changes Made

### Branding
- Renamed the application from **Kanamoni's Interest Calculator** to **Charan Calculator** in the page title and navigation bar.

### Styles
- Set all input placeholder text to a vibrant **GREEN** (`#4ade80`) for better visibility.
- Maintained `color-scheme: dark` for date inputs to ensure browser elements are legible.
- Slightly improved label contrast for better accessibility.

## Verification Results

### HTML Branding in [index.html](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/public/index.html)
```html
<title>Charan Calculator</title>
...
<a class="navbar-brand fw-bold" href="#">Charan Calculator</a>
```

### CSS Changes in [style.css](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/public/css/style.css)
```css
.bg-dark-input::placeholder {
    color: #4ade80 !important;
    opacity: 0.9 !important;
}
```

These changes ensure that the text "Name", "Village", "Age", etc., are now clearly visible as placeholders when the input boxes are empty.
