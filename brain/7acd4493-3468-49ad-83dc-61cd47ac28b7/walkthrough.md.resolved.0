# Visibility Fix Walkthrough

I have improved the visibility of the names and other placeholders in the "Manage Borrowers" modal.

## Changes Made

### Styles
- Added a specific rule for `.bg-dark-input::placeholder` to increase contrast.
- Added `color-scheme: dark` to date inputs to ensure the browser-rendered parts (like the calendar icon and date format) are visible against the dark background.
- Improved cross-browser compatibility for the gradient brand text in the navbar.
- Slightly increased the opacity of smaller labels like "Surety Evidence (Optional)" for better readability.

## Verification Results

### CSS Changes in [style.css](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/public/css/style.css)

```css
.bg-dark-input::placeholder {
    color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.45) !important;
}

input[type="date"].bg-dark-input {
    color-scheme: dark;
}
```

These changes ensure that the text "Name", "Village", "Age", etc., are now clearly visible as placeholders when the input boxes are empty.
