# PWA Conversion Walkthrough

The "Interest Calculator" has been converted into a Progressive Web App (PWA). This allows users to install the app on their devices and provides a more app-like experience.

## Changes Made

### Files Created
- [manifest.json](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/public/manifest.json): Defines the app's name, theme colors, and icons.
- [service-worker.js](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/public/service-worker.js): Handles caching of static assets to improve performance and provide basic offline support for the shell.

### Files Modified
- [index.html](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/public/index.html): Added the manifest link and `theme-color` meta tag.
- [app.js](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/public/js/app.js): Added service worker registration logic.

## Technical Details
- **Standalone Mode**: The app is configured to open in standalone mode (no browser UI).
- **Service Worker**: Caches HTML, CSS, JS, and external CDN assets (Bootstrap, Font Awesome, etc.).
- **Theme Color**: Set to `#2c3e50` to match the app's design.

> [!NOTE]
> Icon generation was attempted but encountered server capacity issues. For production, please ensure `public/icon-192.png` and `public/icon-512.png` are present. I have provided the [manifest.json](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/public/manifest.json) referencing these files.

## How to Verify
1. Open the application in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge).
2. Check for the "Install" icon in the address bar.
3. Open DevTools > Application tab:
   - Verify the **Manifest** is detected.
   - Verify the **Service Worker** is active and running.
   - Check the **Cache Storage** for cached assets.
