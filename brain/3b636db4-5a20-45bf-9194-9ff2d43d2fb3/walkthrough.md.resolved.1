# Walkthrough - Friend Key Removal

I have removed the "Friend Key" locking mechanism to simplify the application and make all features accessible by default.

## Changes Made

### Sidebar Simplification
Removed the "Friend's Key" input and "Unlock" button from the sidebar in [App.jsx](file:///c:/Users/kanam/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/wholesale-vendor-system/src/App.jsx).

### Unified Access
Modified [UnifiedVendors.jsx](file:///c:/Users/kanam/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/wholesale-vendor-system/src/components/UnifiedVendors.jsx) to remove the locking logic. The billing form is now visible and active for all vendors immediately upon selection.

### Enhanced Layout & Visibility
- Removed fixed height constraints from the main layout to prevent squashing elements.
- Adjusted the billing summary styles to ensure numeric values (Subtotal, Balance, etc.) are always visible on the right.
- Improved spacing and responsiveness of the billing form.

### Item Name Suggestions
- Implemented a dropdown/suggestion list for the "Item Name" field.
- Fast selection for common items: **Milk**, **Biscuits**, and **Eggs**.

## Verification Results

### Manual Checks
- [x] Sidebar no longer contains locking UI.
- [x] Vendors tab loads the billing form directly without requiring a passcode.
- [x] All price adjustment features (Normal vs. Settled Price) are fully functional.
- [x] Typing "M" in Item Name shows "Milk" as a suggestion.
- [x] Summary values are clearly aligned and visible.

The development server is still running at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).
