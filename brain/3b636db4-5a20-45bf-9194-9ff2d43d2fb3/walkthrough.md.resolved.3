# Walkthrough - 3-Tab Layout Restoration

I have reverted the application to the three-tab layout as requested, ensuring better space utilization and maintaining the removal of the "Friend Key" activation field.

## Changes Made

### 3-Tab Navigation
Restored the separate tabs in [App.jsx](file:///c:/Users/kanam/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/wholesale-vendor-system/src/App.jsx):
1.  **Dashboard**: High-level overview of total balance and vendor stats.
2.  **Shops**: List of vendors and their specific transaction history.
3.  **Generate Bill**: Dedicated page for creating new bills with item entries.

### Item Name Dropdown
- Integrated the suggestion list (datalist) into the [Billing.jsx](file:///c:/Users/kanam/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/wholesale-vendor-system/src/components/Billing.jsx) component.
- Options for **Milk**, **Biscuits**, and **Eggs** are now available when adding items to a bill.

### Friend Key Removal
- Verified that the "Friend Key" activation field is **not** present in the restored layout. The system is fully unlocked and ready for use.

## Verification Results

### Manual Checks
- [x] Sidebar shows **Dashboard**, **Shops**, and **Generate Bill**.
- [x] Selecting a shop in the Shops tab shows the correct detail view.
- [x] "Generate Bill" tab allows selection of any vendor and entry of multiple items.
- [x] Item name dropdown is functional in the Billing tab.
- [x] No passcode or "Friend Key" prompt is visible.
