# Walkthrough - Dedicated Product Management & Billing

I have implemented a dedicated **Manage Products** tab to simplify inventory management and billing.

## Key Changes

### 1. Dedicated "Manage Products" Tab
A new tab has been added to the sidebar, directly below **Generate Bill**. This section allows you to:
- **Add Items**: Input a name and default price for products.
- **Edit/Delete**: Update prices or remove items as your inventory changes.
- **Automatic Zeros**: When adding or editing prices, the `0` will automatically clear when you click on the field.

### 2. Streamlined Billing & Auto-Fill
The **Generate Bill** tab is now cleaner and works seamlessly with your product list:
- **Auto-Fill Price**: When you select or type a product name that exists in your list, the saved price is automatically filled into the bill.
- **Smart Suggestions**: The product name field now shows a dropdown of all your managed products and their prices.
- **Improved Due Amount**: The "Total Payable" and "New Balance Due" labels are more prominent, clearly showing how current purchases affect the vendor's total debt.

### 3. UX Enhancements
- **Multi-Row Logic**: You can add many rows and only fill some; the system ignores empty rows during save.
- **Vanish Zero**: All numeric fields (Quantities, Prices, Discounts, Paid Amount) automatically clear `0` values when focused.

## Verification Steps

1. **Manage Products**:
   - Go to "Manage Products" in the sidebar.
   - Add a product "Milk" with price "60".
2. **Generate Bill**:
   - Go to "Generate Bill".
   - Select any vendor.
   - In the first row, type "Milk" or select it from the dropdown.
   - Observe the price "60" is filled automatically.
   - Enter quantity "2" and see the row total update to "120".
   - Click "Generate & Save Bill" and verify the success message.
