# Walkthrough - Professional Billing & Print System

I have successfully implemented a professional, paper-ready printing system for your bills. Now, every time you generate a bill, you get a clean, official-looking Tax Invoice.

## New Features

### 1. Professional Tax Invoice
- **Official Format**: The printout is formatted as a professional "TAX INVOICE" on a clean white background with sharp black borders.
- **Shop & Vendor Details**: Automatically includes the **Shop Name** and **Phone Number** at the top.
- **Detailed Item List**: Presents all items bought in a clean table with Description, Quantity, Price, and Amount.

### 2. Complete Financial Summary
The invoice now includes a dedicated footer summary that shows exactly what was asked:
- **Current Bill Total**: Total of items bought in this session.
- **Previous Pending**: Any balance left over before this bill.
- **Total Payable**: The sum of previous due and current bill.
- **Paid Today**: The amount the vendor paid during this transaction.
- **Remaining Balance**: The updated total pending balance.

### 3. Simplified "Save Only" Billing
- **Fast Transactions**: The "Generate Bill" button now focuses purely on saving data. I've removed the automatic print dialog as requested, making record-keeping faster.

### 4. Professional Ledger Printing (Shops)
- **Unified Transaction Ledger**: In the vendor details page, clicking **Download Report (Print)** now generates a professional bank-statement style ledger.
- **Chronological History**: All purchases and payments are listed together by date, giving a clear timeline of the account.
- **Full Item Disclosure**: Every bill in the printout automatically expands to show exactly which items were bought, their quantity, and their price.
- **Clear Financials**: Shows Debit (Purchases), Credit (Payments), and a prominent total pending balance at the top.

## Verification
- Navigate to **Generate Bill** and observe it says "Save Bill".
- Navigate to **Shops**, select a vendor, and click **Download Report (Print)** to see the new chronological ledger format.

1.  Go to **Generate Bill**.
2.  Select a Vendor (notice the previous balance is shown).
3.  Add some items (notice the pricing auto-fills and QTY boxes are larger).
4.  Enter the **Paid Today** amount.
5.  Click **Save & Print Bill**.
6.  The browser's print preview will open. Verify that it looks like a professional invoice with all the details mentioned above.

Everything is now refined, visible, and professional!
