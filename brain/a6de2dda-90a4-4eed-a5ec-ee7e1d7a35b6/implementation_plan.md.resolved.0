# Implementation Plan - Localhost Verification

Verify that the wholesale-vendor-system runs correctly on localhost with the 3-tab layout and product suggestions.

## Proposed Changes

No code changes are required as the project is already in the desired state. The focus is on execution and verification.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Verification (Browser Tool)
1. Run `npm run dev` in the project directory.
2. Capture the local URL from the terminal output (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
3. Open the URL in the browser tool.
4. Verify the following:
   - **Tabs**: Dashboard, Shops, and Generate Bill are present in the sidebar.
   - **Navigation**: Clicking tabs switches the main content correctly.
   - **Billing**: Navigate to "Generate Bill", add a row, and check if "Milk", "Biscuits", and "Eggs" appear as suggestions in the "Product Name" field.
5. Record a video of these actions.

### Manual Verification
1. None required beyond the automated browser verification.
