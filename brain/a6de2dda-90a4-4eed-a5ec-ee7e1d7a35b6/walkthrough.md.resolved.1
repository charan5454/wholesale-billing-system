# Walkthrough - Billing Improvements & Product Management

I have implemented the requested features to enhance the billing system and improve user experience.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Due Amount Tracking
- **Previous Due**: Displays the vendor's outstanding balance when selected.
- **Total Due**: Shows the combined total of the previous due and the current bill.
- **Real-time Updates**: The balance is automatically updated in the database when a bill is saved.

### 2. Product Management
- **Add/Edit/Delete**: A new "Manage Products" section allows you to define products and their default prices.
- **Auto-fill**: Selecting a product from the dropdown in the billing form now automatically fills in the saved price.
- **Custom Dropdown**: Uses a datalist that stays updated with your managed products.

### 3. UI Improvements
- **Vanish Zero**: Number fields containing `0` will now automatically clear when you click on them, making it easier to type.
- **Empty Row Handling**: You can now click "Add Row" multiple times without having to fill every row. Empty rows are automatically ignored when generating the bill.

## Verification

2. Add a product (e.g., "Bread" with price "40").
3. In the billing form, start typing "Bread".
4. Select it from the suggestions and notice the price is auto-filled.

### Due Amount

2. Observe the "Previous Due" in the vendor section and the summary.
3. Observe "Total Due" adding the current bill amount.

### Submission

2. Fill only one row and click **Generate & Save Bill**.
3. The bill will be saved with only the filled data.

### Vanish Zero
1. Click on any field with `0` (like Discount or Quantity).
2. The zero vanishes immediately, allowing you to type your number.
