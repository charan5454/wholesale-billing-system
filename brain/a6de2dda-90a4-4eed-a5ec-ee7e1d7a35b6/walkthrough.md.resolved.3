# Walkthrough - Premium Inventory & Billing

I have completely redesigned the **Manage Products** page to give it a premium, modern look that moves away from the "boxy" feel.

## Visual Upgrades

### 1. Unified Dashboard Layout
- **Two-Column Design**: The "Add New Item" form now sits elegantly on the left, with the "Current Stock" list taking the primary focus on the right.
- **Iconography**: Every section now has a descriptive icon badge to make the interface more intuitive and professional.
- **Subtle Glassmorphism**: Cards use a more refined translucent background with soft borders that blend into the application.

### 2. Premium Product List
- **Table Hover Effects**: Rows now highlight gently as you move your mouse over them, making it easier to track your focus.
- **Price Tags**: Pricing is highlighted with a dedicated accent-color tag and currency symbol.
- **Clean Actions**: Standard buttons have been replaced with professional icons for Editing and Deleting, reducing visual clutter.
- **Empty State**: Added a custom graphic for when the inventory is empty, so the page never looks broken.

### 3. Improved Form Experience
- **Currency Symbols**: Price inputs now display the ₹ symbol directly inside the field for better context.
- **Modern Headlines**: Used high-contrast typography and subtle gradients for a more "expensive" feel.

## Verification

1. **Check the Look**: Open the **Manage Products** tab. You should see a much more cohesive layout with better spacing and professional icons.
2. **Try Actions**: 
   - Add a product and see the new "Add to Inventory" button.
   - Hover over existing products to see the row selection effect.
   - Use the icon-based Edit/Delete buttons.
