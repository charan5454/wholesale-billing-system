# Walkthrough - Professional Billing & Print System

I have successfully implemented a professional, paper-ready printing system for your bills. Now, every time you generate a bill, you get a clean, official-looking Tax Invoice.

## New Features

### 1. Professional Tax Invoice
- **Official Format**: The printout is formatted as a professional "TAX INVOICE" on a clean white background with sharp black borders.
- **Shop & Vendor Details**: Automatically includes the **Shop Name** and **Phone Number** at the top.
- **Detailed Item List**: Presents all items bought in a clean table with Description, Quantity, Price, and Amount.

### 2. Complete Financial Summary
The invoice now includes a dedicated footer summary that shows exactly what was asked:
- **Current Bill Total**: Total of items bought in this session.
- **Previous Pending**: Any balance left over before this bill.
- **Total Payable**: The sum of previous due and current bill.
- **Paid Today**: The amount the vendor paid during this transaction.
- **Remaining Balance**: The updated total pending balance.

### 3. Integrated Print Flow
- **One-Click Action**: When you click **Save & Print Bill**, the system saves the record to your database and immediately opens the print window.
- **Clean Printing**: I've added special rules to hide the sidebar, navigation, and buttons during printing. Only the invoice itself will appear on the paper.

### 4. Comprehensive Vendor Statements
- **Full History Printout**: In the vendor details page, clicking "Download Report (Print)" now generates a complete **Statement of Account**.
- **All Details Included**: This statement lists every single past bill (automatically expanding and showing all items bought) and every payment made.
- **Ledger Format**: Formatted like a professional financial statement with totals and a clear current pending balance at the top.

## Verification

1.  Go to **Generate Bill**.
2.  Select a Vendor (notice the previous balance is shown).
3.  Add some items (notice the pricing auto-fills and QTY boxes are larger).
4.  Enter the **Paid Today** amount.
5.  Click **Save & Print Bill**.
6.  The browser's print preview will open. Verify that it looks like a professional invoice with all the details mentioned above.

Everything is now refined, visible, and professional!
