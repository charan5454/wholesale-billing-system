# Implementation Plan - Dedicated Product Management

Establish a clear separation of concerns by moving product management to its own dedicated tab and refining the billing workflow.

## Proposed Changes

### [New Product Management Component](file:///c:/Users/kanam/..gemini/antigravity/scratch/wholesale-vendor-system/src/components/ProductManagement.jsx)
- [NEW] Create `ProductManagement.jsx` to handle additions, edits, and deletions of products and their default prices.
- [NEW] Implement the "vanish zero" logic for the price input field.

### [App Navigation](file:///c:/Users/kanam/..gemini/antigravity/scratch/wholesale-vendor-system/src/App.jsx)
- [MODIFY] Add a new sidebar link for "Manage Items".
- [MODIFY] Add logic to render the `ProductManagement` component when the tab is active.

### [Billing Component](file:///c:/Users/kanam/..gemini/antigravity/scratch/wholesale-vendor-system/src/components/Billing.jsx)
- [MODIFY] Remove the embedded "Manage Products" section.
- [MODIFY] Ensure selecting a product from the list auto-fills the price reliably.
- [MODIFY] Refine total due amount display to be more prominent.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. **Manage Items**:
   - Navigate to the new "Manage Items" tab.
   - Add "Bread" with price "35".
   - Edit the price to "40".
   - Delete a test item.
2. **Billing**:
   - Go to "Generate Bill".
   - Select a vendor.
   - Verify "Previous Due" is shown.
   - Add a row and select "Bread". Verify price "40" is auto-filled.
   - Click on price field; verify `0` vanishes.
   - Leave some rows empty and click "Generate Bill". Verify success.
