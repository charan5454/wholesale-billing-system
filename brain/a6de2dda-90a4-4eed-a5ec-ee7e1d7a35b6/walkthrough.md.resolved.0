# Walkthrough - Local Implementation

The application has been started on localhost. However, due to a technical limitation with the browser tool, automated verification could not be completed.

## Changes Made

No code changes were requested or made, as the project was already in the desired state.

## Verification Results

### Development Server
The development server was started successfully using `npm run dev`.

### Browser Verification
> [!WARNING]
> The automated browser tool failed to initialize due to a system environment error (`$HOME environment variable is not set`).

### Manual Action Required
