# Implementation Plan - Wholesale Vendor Billing and Credit Management System

Build a comprehensive web-based system for wholesale shop owners to manage vendor accounts, billing, and credit tracking with a premium, high-end UI.

## Proposed Changes

### Core Infrastructure
- Initialize a Vite + React project for a responsive, fast SPA experience.
- Implement a **Vanilla CSS** design system with:
    - Dark mode theme with glassmorphism effects.
    - Custom CSS variables for consistent spacing and colors.
    - Responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

### Data Management
- Implement a Local Storage based persistence layer for vendor and transaction data.
- Create utility functions for calculating totals, balances, and applying discounts.

### Component Features
- **Dashboard**: High-level metrics for today's sales, received payments, and total pending amounts.
- **Vendor Management**: CRUD operations for retail shop owners.
- **Billing System**: Dynamic form for product entry, auto-calculating totals, and handling partial payments.
- **Credit Tracking**: Detailed ledger for each vendor showing purchase and payment history.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run build` to ensure the project compiles correctly.
- Use the `browser` tool to:
    1.  Add a new vendor and verify they appear in the list.
    2.  Create a bill for a vendor and verify the pending balance updates.
    3.  Enter a future payment and verify the pending balance decreases.
    4.  Check dashboard metrics after transactions.

### Manual Verification
- Verify responsiveness on mobile/tablet screen sizes using Chrome DevTools.
- Ensure the UI feels "premium" with smooth hover effects and transitions.
