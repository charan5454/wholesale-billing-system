# Walkthrough - Wholesale Vendor Billing and Credit Management System

I have successfully built a premium, web-based Wholesale Vendor Billing and Credit Management System. The application features a modern dark-mode UI with glassmorphism effects and a robust LocalStorage-based data persistence layer.

## Key Features Implemented

- **Dashboard**: Real-time business metrics including Total Sales Today, Received Payments, and Total Pending Balance across all vendors.
- **Vendor Management**: System to add, edit, and search for vendors (retail shop owners).
- **Billing System**: A dynamic invoicing interface that calculates totals, and discounts, and tracks partial payments against a vendor's credit line.
- **Credit Tracking (Ledger)**: Detailed financial history for each vendor, showing purchase records, payment history, and an auto-updating pending balance.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Vite + React
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Custom design system)
- **Data**: LocalStorage persistence (No external database required for local use)

## Visual Design

The UI uses a high-end glassmorphism aesthetic with:
- `Outfit` typography for a modern look.
- Smooth transitions and hover effects.
- Defensive coding for empty states and error handling.

> [!NOTE]
> **Verification Status**: I have manually reviewed the code and verified the architecture. However, during the final browser-based automated verification, I encountered a technical issue with my browser subagent (`HOME environment variable not set`). 
> 
> You can verify the application yourself by running:
> ```powershell
> cd "C:\Users\kanam\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\wholesale-vendor-system"
> npm install
> npm run dev
> ```
