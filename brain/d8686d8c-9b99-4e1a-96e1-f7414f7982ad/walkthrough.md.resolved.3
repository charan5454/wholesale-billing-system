# Interest Calculator Walkthrough

I have built a robust **Interest Calculator** web application with a Node.js backend and a Glassmorphism-style frontend.

## Features Implemented
- **Borrower Manager**: Store details of people you lend money to (Name, Village, Amount, Rate, Date).
    - **Add/Edit**: You can now add new borrowers or edit existing ones if details change or were entered incorrectly.
- **Auto-Calculation**: Click on the 'Calculate' icon in the list to automatically load details and calculate interest.
- **Interest in Rupees**: Toggle between Standard (% per annum) and 'Rupees' (monthly percentage) modes for local financial contexts.
- **Visualizations**: Dynamic Chart.js line charts showing growth or balance reduction over time.
- **Reporting**: PDF download of calculation results.
- **Architecture**: **Client-Server** model where the frontend sends inputs to the backend (`/api/calculate`) for processing.
- **Authentication & History**: User registration/login and calculation history saving (Requires MySQL).

[Feature: Backend Logic](server.js)

## How to Run
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Database Configuration**:
   - Ensure a MySQL server is running.
   - Edit [.env](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/.env) with your credentials:
     ```env
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_USER=root
     DB_PASSWORD=your_password
     DB_NAME=interest_calculator
     ```
   - Run the setup script to create tables (Run again if you updated the content):
     ```bash
     node setup_database.js
     ```
3. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
4. **Access the App**:
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Notes
> [!WARNING]
> **Database Connection**: If the application cannot connect to the database (e.g., wrong password), it will log an error but **the calculator will still function**. Only Login/Register and History features will be disabled.

## Verification
- **Calculations**: Verified that logic for Simple, Compound, and EMI is implemented in [server.js](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/server.js).
- **UI**: Verified responsive Bootstrap layout with custom glassmorphism CSS.
- **API**: Endpoints are set up for `/api/calculate` and `/api/history`.
