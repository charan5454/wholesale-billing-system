### Login Modal Visibility (Mobile)
- Reduced the `z-index` of the navbar and its collapse menu. Previously, they were set to `9999` and `10000`, which caused them to cover the login modal's backdrop and inputs. They are now set to `1030` and `1031`, which is below Bootstrap's modal level (`1050+`).
- Improved form input contrast and label visibility within modals.
- Added a fix to prevent mobile browsers from auto-zooming when focusing on input fields.

### PDF Download Fix
- Replaced the Rupee symbol (`₹`) with `Rs.` in the PDF generation logic. Standard PDF fonts do not support the Unicode Rupee symbol, which was causing the generation to fail silently.
- Verified that both the "Calculation Report" and "Borrower Settlement Report" now use `Rs.` to ensure successful downloads.

### Navigation Improvement
- Added logic to automatically close the mobile navbar menu after a link (like "Borrowers" or "Login") is clicked, providing a smoother user experience.

## Verification Results

### CSS z-index
The sticky navbar now respects modal layers:
```css
.bg-dark-glass { z-index: 1030 !important; }
.navbar-collapse { z-index: 1031 !important; }
```

### PDF Logic
Strings containing currency are now sanitized:
```javascript
doc.text(`Total Interest: ${resInterest.textContent.replace('₹', 'Rs.')}`, 20, 90);
```
