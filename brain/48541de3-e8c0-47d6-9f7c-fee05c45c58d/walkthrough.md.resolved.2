# Walkthrough: Mobile Refinements & Bug Fixes

I have completed the requested branding refinements and resolved the issues with the login modal and PDF downloads.

## Changes Made

### 1. Branding Refinements (Mobile)
- **Bigger Title**: Increased the font size of "Kanamoni's Interest Calculator" from `1.0rem` to `1.4rem`.
- **Lower Alignment**: Added top padding to the title to align it further down on small screens.
- **Notch Support**: Added `viewport-fit=cover` to the meta tags to ensure the app looks proper on modern phones with notches.

### 2. Login Modal Fixes (Mobile)
- **z-index Conflict**: Reduced the navbar's z-index so it stays behind the login modal. Previously, the open mobile menu was covering the login boxes.
- **Input Visibility**: Improved contrast for labels and inputs inside modals.
- **Auto-Zoom Fix**: Set input font-size to `16px` on mobile to prevent browsers from automatically zooming in when you tap a field.

### 3. PDF Download Fix
- **Rupee Symbol Encoding**: Replaced the `₹` symbol with `Rs.` in the PDF generator. Standard PDF fonts didn't recognize the symbol, which was causing the download to fail silently.
- **Verified Reports**: Both the main calculator report and borrower settlement reports are now working.

### 4. Navigation Improvement
- **Auto-Close Menu**: The mobile navbar menu now closes automatically after you click a link (like "Borrowers" or "Login").

## Verification Results

The changes were applied specifically for screen widths under `576px` where applicable, ensuring the desktop website remains unchanged.
