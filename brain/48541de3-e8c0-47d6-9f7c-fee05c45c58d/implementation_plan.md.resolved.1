# Implementation Plan: Fix Login Modal and PDF Download

The goal is to fix the visibility of the login modal on mobile and ensure the PDF download works correctly.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component Name] [interest-calculator]

#### [MODIFY] [style.css](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/AntigravityCodes/interest-calculator/public/css/style.css)
- Reduce `z-index` of `.bg-dark-glass` and `.navbar-collapse` to `1030` and `1031` respectively. This ensures they stay below Bootstrap's modal backdrop (1050) and modal content (1055).
- Ensure `.form-control` has sufficient contrast within modals.

#### [MODIFY] [app.js](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/AntigravityCodes/interest-calculator/public/js/app.js)
- Add logic to close the navbar collapse when a navigation link is clicked on mobile.
- In `downloadPdf` and `downloadBorrowerPdf`, replace the Rupee symbol (`₹`) with `Rs.` before passing strings to `jsPDF.text()`. This prevents encoding errors that block the download.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- **Modal Visibility**: Open the login modal on mobile. Verify that the navbar menu is NOT covering it and that the input fields/labels are clearly visible.
- **PDF Download**: Perform a calculation and click "Download Report". Verify that the PDF is generated and downloaded successfully.
- **Navbar Auto-close**: Click any link in the mobile navbar. Verify that the menu closes automatically.
