# Implementation Plan: Refine Mobile Responsiveness

The goal is to improve the appearance of "Kanamoni's Interest Calculator" on mobile devices by making it larger and better aligned, without affecting the desktop experience.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component Name] [interest-calculator]

#### [MODIFY] [index.html](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/AntigravityCodes/interest-calculator/public/index.html)
- Add `viewport-fit=cover` to the `viewport` meta tag to ensure the application displays correctly on phones with notches, preventing content from being cut off or poorly aligned.

#### [MODIFY] [style.css](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/AntigravityCodes/interest-calculator/public/css/style.css)
- Inside the `@media (max-width: 576px)` block:
    - Increase `.navbar-brand` `font-size` from `1.0rem` to `1.4rem`.
    - Add `padding-top: 15px` to `.navbar-brand` to align it "somewhat down".
    - Increase navbar padding to provide more breathing room.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Resize the browser to mobile width (less than 576px) and check the navbar brand size and alignment.
- Verify that the desktop view remains unchanged (font size should be as before).
- Examine the spacing around the status bar/notch (if possible via simulator or mental model of `viewport-fit=cover`).
