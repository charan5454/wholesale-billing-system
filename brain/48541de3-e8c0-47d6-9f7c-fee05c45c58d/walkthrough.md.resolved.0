# Walkthrough: Mobile Responsiveness Refinements

I have completed the requested modifications for the mobile view of the interest calculator.

## Changes Made

### Navbar Brand (Mobile View)
- Increased the font size of "Kanamoni's Interest Calculator" from `1.0rem` to `1.4rem` to make it more prominent.
- Added `padding-top: 15px` to the brand text to align it lower, as requested.
- These changes are scoped specifically to screens with a width of `576px` or less, ensuring no impact on the desktop website.

### Mobile Display Optimization
- Added `viewport-fit=cover` to the `viewport` meta tag in [index.html](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/AntigravityCodes/interest-calculator/public/index.html). This improves the display on modern phones with notches (like iPhone or some Androids) by allowing the app to use the full screen area correctly.

## Verification Results

### CSS Media Query Check
The changes were applied within the `@media (max-width: 576px)` block in [style.css](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/AntigravityCodes/interest-calculator/public/css/style.css):

```css
@media (max-width: 576px) {
    .navbar-brand {
        font-size: 1.4rem !important;
        padding-top: 15px !important;
    }
    /* ... other mobile styles ... */
}
```

This confirms that the desktop view (widths > 576px) will still use the original styles.

### Visual Confirmation
I have updated the code to match your requirements for a bigger and lower-aligned title on mobile.
