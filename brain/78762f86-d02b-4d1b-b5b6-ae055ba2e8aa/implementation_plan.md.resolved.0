# Enhancing Borrower Interest Calculations

This plan outlines the changes needed to set the Rupee (₹) as the default currency and implement precise, date-based interest calculations for borrowers.

## Proposed Changes

### UI Updates
- Set ₹ as the default currency in [index.html](file:///c:/Users/kanam/OneDrive/Antigravity%20Codes/interest-calculator/public/index.html).
- Update the borrower "Action" button to calculate interest based on the exact time period from the loan date to today.

### Calculation Logic
- Update borrower interest calculation to include days for precision.
- Implement a display for the time period (years, months, days) when calculating borrower debt.

## Verification Plan
- Manually test the currency dropdown default.
- Verify borrower interest calculation with specific dates (e.g., loan taken 1 month and 15 days ago).
